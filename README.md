# Customer Behavior Analysis (RFM Model)

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using RFM analysis:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase
- **Monetary**: How much they spend

Data was cleaned and analyzed in SQL (BigQuery) and visualized in R using `ggplot2`. Outputs include:

- Segmented RFM table
- Customer recency bar chart
- Frequency vs. monetary heatmap
